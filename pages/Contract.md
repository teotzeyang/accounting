	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- The next step is to identify the performance obligations in the contract
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Thirdly, the company needs to determine the transaction price
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Next, the transaction price should be allocated to the three performance obligations in the contract. An overall discount compared to the aggregate of standalone selling prices is allocated between the three performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Finally, revenue is recognized when the company satisfies a performance obligation
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number

		- Legal title to the asset
		- Physical possession of the asset
